# Mobile phones have been evolving, along with the respective cellular networks, bandwidths and protocols. 

1G standard was first used in 1981. And in 2018, 5G was introduced, whose signal quality can handle dense cells on millimeter waves.
Below captioned are the list of mobile phone standards and the comparison chart among them.

[5G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G) is a cutting-edge network protocol designed to provide faster and smoother data transfer. It boasts high speed and has the capability to handle a larger number of connections with greater accuracy and lower latency than 4G networks. As technology evolves, more devices and mobile apps are requiring faster internet connectivity. 5G will meet these demands and enable innovative uses such as smart home appliances, UHD streaming, virtual reality, and connected-city safety. For SDETs and DevOps, the transition to 5G involves extensive [mobile app testing](https://github.com/lana-20/i_sliced_up_fun-SQA-mnemonic#readme) to ensure compatibility with previous protocols, secure against security vulnerabilities, and optimize apps to fully utilize the capabilities of this ultrafast network.

5G is not simply an improvement on 4G network but a completely new communication protocol. It requires new devices, radio stations, and careful planning for its implementation. While some major cities in the US already have 5G, it is still being fine-tuned for wider commercial and consumer use.

Two things to note about 5G: it is not your 5GHz Wi-Fi at home, which is a short-range Wi-Fi band, and it is not "millimeter-wave 5G", a marketing term used by some mobile carriers for 5G-certified devices that still use 4G towers and have similar bandwidth and limitations as 4G.

The main difference between 5G and 4G is speed. 5G can handle higher volumes of complex data at speeds up to 20 times faster than 4G, thanks to its use of radio frequencies between 30 GHz and 300 GHz, which provide wider channels and less interference.

5G also enhances the user experience by supporting more device connections, faster transfer of large data, and improved video quality for AR/VR and video streaming.

For SDETs and DevOps, the challenges of 5G include compatibility with older devices and protocols, interoperability across apps, platforms, and operating systems, and security. The adoption of 5G will also require upgrading existing 4G towers and app architecture.

5G presents opportunities for app developers to create new UIs with richer functionality, but DevOps will need to use AI/ML algorithms for continuous improvement. 5G is also a key enabler for IoT, as it can support a large number of devices with longer battery life and real-time communication.
